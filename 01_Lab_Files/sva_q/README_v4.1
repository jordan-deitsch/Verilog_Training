#### To prepare the labs for a class:

 1. tar -zxvf <path to file_name.tgz>
 (or first gunzip <path to file_name.tgz>
 then tar -xvf <path to file_name.tar> if -z option unsupported)

#### Database checkout

   $ cd database_test

------For Questasim:
   $ make

------For VCS
   $ make vcs

------For Xceilium
   $ make xrun

------For Vivado
   $ make viv

The output should end with messages like the following. Your simulator may reformat the text a little
but the messages should be very similar:

# 5 state machine:  illegal op received
